										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital literacy- a term of immense relevance in the present. According to the UNICEF, it refers to the knowledge, skills and attitudes that allow one to be both safe and empowered in an increasingly digital world. The present scenario of digitalization broadly includes learning, researching, socializing and participating. With almost all aspects of education being covered digitally, digital literacy plays a vital role. One should be digitally literate to not only use the internet wisely but to use it with safety too. Cyber safety, hence is also an important aspect of being a digital literate. An individual needs to be cautious and alert of the various cyber-crimes/ threats that he/ she might be exposed to, while making use of the internet. As correctly said by the UNICEF, digital literacy allows one to be both safe and empowered in this digital World. While most of us are aware of how we are digitally empowered, many do not know how their safety is a threat.</p>
<p>Digital literacy is not just a requirement, but a right. Hence the present generations must make themselves literate and educated enough to be aware of all facets of this term called ‘digital literacy’. In a World dominated by internet and surfing skills, we ought to make ourselves both, empowered and safe! While empowering ourself we should never neglect the most important feature of this digital World to “Be Safe”.</p>
<p>As today we all know that without technology we could not survive during this pandemic only technology made our lives go smooth, and this has made us get over from this toughest time of the century. Online classes made our students learn new aspects of life in new dimension. All the offices work 24 X 7 with the work from home feature and saved on the electricity and other office cost as per other basic needs there.<br />
New learning from home research, Innovation and creation displayed its new dimension with the technical proficient staff and workaholics. Teaching learning and self-development has opened new windows for every innovator with the help of Communication Collaboration and Participation.<br />
While learning, Innovating and achieving through Digital Literacy ones digital Identity should be always kept safe as it’s the concern of their wellbeing and safety and security.</p>
