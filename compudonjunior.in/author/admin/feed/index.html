										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It would not be wrong to say that every internet user understands that it is absolutely crucial to have unique and complex passwords. And that the majority of internet users often create accounts with passwords containing 6-8 characters, including letters, numbers, and special characters. Many believe that they are well-informed about secure passwords and no longer check the requirements for strong passwords.</p>
<p>However, statistics reveal that <strong><em>95% of breaches stem from human errors</em></strong>. Given the rising cyber threats, it&#8217;s crucial to take proactive measures to mitigate human-related risks, particularly by focusing on <strong><em>fundamental yet critical aspects such as improving password management.</em></strong> Recognizing the significance of robust password practices and the severe repercussions of breaches, International Password Change Day is gaining recognition.</p>
<p>It is impractical to remember numerous different passwords, leading to password fatigue. Implementing system rules on password length and requiring regular password renewals or using a separate password manager is an essential step. A master password used with two-factor authentication provides additional protection.</p>
<p>Dedicated password managers offer advanced security features and adhere to higher security standards, prioritizing security and privacy. On the other hand, browser-based password managers, designed for convenience, pose risks as they save passwords and offer quick autofill, making it easier for unauthorized access. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid browser-based password managers. <strong>The dedicated password manager provides following significant advantages:          </strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Enhanced Security :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong, Unique Passwords &#8211;</strong>Password managers generate and store random, complex, and unique passwords for each of your accounts, significantly reducing the risk of hacking due to weak or reused passwords.</li>
<li><strong>Encrypted Storage &#8211;</strong> Password managers encrypt your passwords, ensuring they are stored securely and protected from unauthorized access.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Convenience:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Autofill-</strong> Password managers can automatically fill in login credentials for websites and applications, saving time and reducing the hassle of remembering multiple passwords.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Platform Sync-</strong> Most password managers sync across multiple devices and platforms, allowing you to access your passwords from anywhere securely.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Organization and Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Centralized Storage-</strong> Password managers store all your passwords in one place, making it easier to manage and organize your credentials.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Notes and Information-</strong> Many password managers also allow you to store other sensitive information, such as credit card details, secure notes, and personal information, in an encrypted format.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Improved Productivity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduced Password Reset</strong>: With all passwords securely stored and easily accessible, the need for frequent password resets due to forgotten passwords is minimized, saving time and reducing frustration.</li>
<li><strong>Streamlined Access</strong>: Password managers simplify the login process for multiple accounts, enabling quicker access to necessary tools and resources, thereby enhancing productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Protection Against Phishing Attacks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Autofill Accuracy</strong>: Password managers can recognize legitimate websites and auto-fill login details only for known sites, helping to protect against phishing attacks by preventing you from entering credentials on fake websites.</li>
<li><strong>Security Alerts</strong>: Many password managers offer security alerts for compromised websites, prompting you to change passwords that may have been exposed in data breaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, as we navigate an increasingly digital world fraught with cyber threats, it&#8217;s evident that human error remains a significant contributor to breaches. By prioritizing proactive measures such as enhancing password management, we can strengthen our defenses against cyberattacks. The emergence of initiatives like International Password Change Day underscores the importance of this endeavor. Let us take heed of these insights and commit to safeguarding our digital assets through vigilant cybersecurity practices. Together, we can build a safer online environment for all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A generation ago, IT and digital media were niche skills. Today, they are a core competency necessary to succeed in almost all fields.<span id="dots1">&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span id="more1">Let’s face it, Technology is impacting all areas of our lives and this impact is accelerating every day. So much so that <strong>Experts are predicting that 90% of the entire population will be connected to the internet within next 10 years. Experts are also predicting that almost 90% jobs of future don’t exist today.</strong> With the internet of things, the digital and physical worlds will soon be merged. While these changes announce new &amp; exciting possibilities but at the same time, they are also creating uncertainty &amp; insecurity.</p>
<p><strong>Excitement</strong>&#8211; because these changes are creating huge opportunities and<strong> Insecurity</strong>&#8211; because our kids are exposed to huge risks at the same time. Risks that are very real, such as, cyberbullying, undesirable, obscene and violent content, radicalization, hacking, identity theft, scams etc. The problem becomes critical because the digital world is changing too much and too fast. And practical issues in updating the school curricula, the slow pace of internet governance and policies for protection of kids is adding to the problem.</p>
<p>We must also be equally concerned about the digital age gap. The usage of technology by kids and by adults is very different which makes it difficult for parents and educators to fully understand &amp; appreciate the risks and threats that kids are exposed to online. As a result, adults are not able to advise children on the safe and responsible use of digital technologies.</p>
<p><strong>So how can we, as parents, educators and leaders, prepare our children for the digital age? Without a doubt, it is critical for us to equip them with skills of the 21st century. </strong>As Parents, educators &amp; leaders, we must use encourage our kids to acquire the digital skills and skills of the 21st century. And championships such as COMPUDON JUNIOR solve part of the puzzle by giving kids the needed digital literacy skills.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The American Library Association&#8217;s digital-literacy task force offers this definition: &#8220;Digital literacy is the ability to use information and communication technologies to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information, requiring both cognitive and technical skills.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more"><br />
Today&#8217;s children are digital natives. They are born in an era of Technology. As a result, they learn digital skills just like learning a language, without even realizing they are learning it. Today it is not uncommon for a 3-4-year-old to have some basic knowledge regarding how to get on to the computer and load a game or play a video.</p>
<p>Acquiring digital literacy skills will also help participating students acquire the following skills that they would need in order to function effectively in digital environments.</p>
<p><a class="title-default-left"><strong>GRAPHIC LITERACY</strong></a><br />
Tasks include working with graphic user interfaces that help them to “read” naturally and freely and to understand the instructions and messages represented visually. Students will develop good visual memory and strong thinking, which will help them understand visual messages easily and fluently.</p>
<p><a class="title-default-left"><strong>INFORMATION LITERACY</strong></a><br />
The effort they will put in to identify, locate, evaluate, and effectively use the information to solve the problem / tasks of the COMPUDON Junior exam will help them develop this literacy.</p>
<p><a class="title-default-left"><strong>SOCIO-EMOTIONAL LITERACY</strong></a><br />
A championship for school students from junior classes is based on Microsoft’s Digital Literacy Standard version 4 and while going through the course, students will develop knowledge to avoid “traps” as well as derive benefits from the advantages of digital communication.</p>
<p>Some experts prefer the term &#8220;digital literacies,&#8221; to convey the many facets of what reading and writing in the modern era entails.</span></p>
