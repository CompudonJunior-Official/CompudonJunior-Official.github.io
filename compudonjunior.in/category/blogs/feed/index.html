										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It would not be wrong to say that every internet user understands that it is absolutely crucial to have unique and complex passwords. And that the majority of internet users often create accounts with passwords containing 6-8 characters, including letters, numbers, and special characters. Many believe that they are well-informed about secure passwords and no longer check the requirements for strong passwords.</p>
<p>However, statistics reveal that <strong><em>95% of breaches stem from human errors</em></strong>. Given the rising cyber threats, it&#8217;s crucial to take proactive measures to mitigate human-related risks, particularly by focusing on <strong><em>fundamental yet critical aspects such as improving password management.</em></strong> Recognizing the significance of robust password practices and the severe repercussions of breaches, International Password Change Day is gaining recognition.</p>
<p>It is impractical to remember numerous different passwords, leading to password fatigue. Implementing system rules on password length and requiring regular password renewals or using a separate password manager is an essential step. A master password used with two-factor authentication provides additional protection.</p>
<p>Dedicated password managers offer advanced security features and adhere to higher security standards, prioritizing security and privacy. On the other hand, browser-based password managers, designed for convenience, pose risks as they save passwords and offer quick autofill, making it easier for unauthorized access. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid browser-based password managers. <strong>The dedicated password manager provides following significant advantages:          </strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Enhanced Security :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong, Unique Passwords &#8211;</strong>Password managers generate and store random, complex, and unique passwords for each of your accounts, significantly reducing the risk of hacking due to weak or reused passwords.</li>
<li><strong>Encrypted Storage &#8211;</strong> Password managers encrypt your passwords, ensuring they are stored securely and protected from unauthorized access.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Convenience:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Autofill-</strong> Password managers can automatically fill in login credentials for websites and applications, saving time and reducing the hassle of remembering multiple passwords.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Platform Sync-</strong> Most password managers sync across multiple devices and platforms, allowing you to access your passwords from anywhere securely.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Organization and Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Centralized Storage-</strong> Password managers store all your passwords in one place, making it easier to manage and organize your credentials.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Notes and Information-</strong> Many password managers also allow you to store other sensitive information, such as credit card details, secure notes, and personal information, in an encrypted format.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Improved Productivity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduced Password Reset</strong>: With all passwords securely stored and easily accessible, the need for frequent password resets due to forgotten passwords is minimized, saving time and reducing frustration.</li>
<li><strong>Streamlined Access</strong>: Password managers simplify the login process for multiple accounts, enabling quicker access to necessary tools and resources, thereby enhancing productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Protection Against Phishing Attacks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Autofill Accuracy</strong>: Password managers can recognize legitimate websites and auto-fill login details only for known sites, helping to protect against phishing attacks by preventing you from entering credentials on fake websites.</li>
<li><strong>Security Alerts</strong>: Many password managers offer security alerts for compromised websites, prompting you to change passwords that may have been exposed in data breaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, as we navigate an increasingly digital world fraught with cyber threats, it&#8217;s evident that human error remains a significant contributor to breaches. By prioritizing proactive measures such as enhancing password management, we can strengthen our defenses against cyberattacks. The emergence of initiatives like International Password Change Day underscores the importance of this endeavor. Let us take heed of these insights and commit to safeguarding our digital assets through vigilant cybersecurity practices. Together, we can build a safer online environment for all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Excessive screen time among students can indeed have negative consequences on their academic performance, overall development and on situational awareness. Here are some specific ways it can impact them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lack of engagement with the physical environment: When students spend excessive time on devices, they become less engaged with their immediate surroundings. They may fail to notice important details or changes in their environment, which can affect their safety and ability to respond effectively to situations.</li>
<li>Reduced social interactions: Over-reliance on devices can lead to decreased face-to-face social interactions. This can hinder the development of important social skills, including reading non-verbal cues, interpreting social dynamics, and understanding situational context.</li>
<li>Impaired attention and concentration: Continuous exposure to screens can lead to reduced attention span and difficulties in maintaining focus. This can impact students&#8217; ability to process information from their environment, leading to a decreased situational awareness.</li>
<li>Cyberbullying and online risks: Spending excessive time online increases the risk of students becoming victims of cyberbullying or falling prey to online scams, predators, or inappropriate content. Engaging in such experiences can distract students from their immediate surroundings and compromise their situational awareness.</li>
</ol>
<p>Came across a school incident recently. Please watch this video at the link below:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaqzyQH79d4&amp;t=33s">Situational Awareness</a></strong></p>
<p>To address these concerns and promote better situational awareness among students, here are some strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Encourage device-free activities: Encourage students to participate in activities that do not involve screens, such as outdoor play, sports, hobbies, or creative endeavors. This helps them engage with their physical environment and develop a broader awareness of their surroundings.</li>
<li>Educate about online safety: Teach students about responsible internet use, including how to identify and respond to cyberbullying, how to protect personal information online, and how to navigate online risks. By empowering them to make informed choices, they can better manage their online experiences and maintain situational awareness.</li>
<li>Foster face-to-face interactions: Create opportunities for students to interact and collaborate in person. Encourage group discussions, teamwork, and classroom activities that promote social engagement and communication. This helps students develop social skills and situational awareness in real-world settings.</li>
<li>Set boundaries on screen time: Establish clear guidelines and limits on screen time both at school and at home. Encourage students to take regular breaks from screens, engage in physical activities, and spend time with family and friends. Balancing screen time with other activities helps students maintain a healthier sense of situational awareness.</li>
</ol>
<p>By promoting a balanced approach to technology use and providing opportunities for students to engage with the physical world and interact face-to-face, educators and parents can help mitigate the negative effects of excessive screen time and support students&#8217; situational awareness.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s blog post is about the latest cybercrime that made headlines in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. This cybercrime victimized 80 people over a period of 16 days and collectively siphoned off almost 1 crore rupees (99.12 lakhs). This incident serves as a <strong>reminder that we need to be cautious before clicking on any link and be careful about sharing our personal and confidential information</strong>.</p>
<p>The cyber fraudsters duped 80 individuals who had their own bank accounts. <em><strong>They were sent messages of account deactivation or suspension due to KYC update pending or PAN card not updated, but the messages were not sent by the bank but by the fraudsters! As a result, these individuals lost money from their accounts.</strong></em></p>
<p>Authorities have not found any data leak from the bank&#8217;s side, but they are still investigating the point of data leak that put these 80 individuals in this situation. <em>It is uncertain whether these individuals will get their money back from the bank, as they clicked on the link without verifying and divulged their account information, despite constant warnings from banks. The Cyber Crime Unit of the Mumbai Crime Branch has taken up the case and hopes to achieve a breakthrough.</em></p>
<p>The list of individuals who were duped in this crime includes actor-politician Nagma, actor Malavika aka Shweta Menon, as well as other professionals, students, housewives, and retired senior citizens.</p>
<p>The Cyber Crime Unit is equipped with all the technical details to carry out the probe. They have issued warnings to customers to not panic on receiving such messages and instead get in touch with their respective banks personally instead of searching for the numbers on the internet.</p>
<p>The team is finding out and tracking from which subsidiary sub-lending financial institutions the data breach has occurred. They have also found the module of the organized crime syndicate involved in the fraud. However, it is too early to disclose their details. The total cases registered in the city till date tallied at 80.</p>
<p>In order to track down the scamsters, the Cyber Crime Unit has sought details of the 300 fake accounts and the 100 SIMs the fraudsters procured using fake documents. <em>DCP (Mumbai-Cyber Crime) Dr. Balsing Rajput shared that no banks or financial institutions or service providers will warn anyone of the suspension of their accounts.</em></p>

<p>We hope this post helps you stay alert and safe while navigating the cyber world. Remember, always be cautious before clicking on any link and never share your personal or confidential information without verifying the source.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-portfolio wp-image-4834" src="https://compudonjunior.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pexels-andrew-neel-15863066-495x400.jpg" alt="" width="495" height="400" srcset="https://compudonjunior.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pexels-andrew-neel-15863066-495x400.jpg 495w, https://compudonjunior.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pexels-andrew-neel-15863066-845x684.jpg 845w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px" /></p>
<p>ChatGPT, launched on November 30, 2022 has taken the world of technology by storm. After just two months, the AI chatbot has built a base of 100 million active users. A study from investment bank UBS says that ChatGPT&#8217;s growth rate makes it one of the fastest-growing apps in history.</p>
<p>ChatGPT is an AI language model and an incredible technology that is revolutionizing the way we interact with machines. For junior students who are just beginning to explore the world of technology, ChatGPT is an exciting and accessible way to learn about the possibilities of this rapidly advancing field of Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>At its core, ChatGPT is a language model that has been trained on a vast amount of data from the internet. This means that it is able to generate responses to user queries that are not only accurate but also contextually appropriate. It can converse on a wide range of topics, from science and technology to sports and entertainment, and can even help with homework assignments.</p>
<p>One of the great things about ChatGPT is that it is available to anyone with an internet connection, which means that students can access its vast stores of knowledge from anywhere in the world. This makes it an incredibly valuable tool for learning, as it provides students with instant access to information that would have been difficult to find otherwise.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of ChatGPT is its ability to adapt and learn from user interactions. As students engage with the model and ask it questions, it is able to refine its responses and become even more accurate over time. This means that the more students use ChatGPT, the more valuable it becomes as a learning tool. Hence, ChatGPT can also provide personalized recommendations based on a student&#8217;s learning history, helping them to improve their academic performance over time.</p>
<p>We all have done our schooling and one thing that has remained consistent throughout the past is the “Homework”.  Using ChatGPT, it becomes much easier finishing the homework. For example, a student gets a homework assignment to write a 4 page essay on certain topic. Getting this done using ChatGPT will not even take a minute.</p>
<p>Now, some schools in the US and other countries are discouraging their students from using ChatGPT at this stage. But, some other schools are teaching their students about the tool, what to learn from it, what are the purposes they should use it for and NOT use it for, as they do not want for their students to miss out on the opportunity to use and learn about ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Overall, ChatGPT is an exciting and powerful technology that has the potential to transform the way we learn and interact with machines. For junior students who are just beginning to explore the world of AI, it is an accessible and user-friendly tool that can help them discover the possibilities of this rapidly evolving field. By leveraging the power of ChatGPT, students can gain access to vast stores of knowledge and explore the world in new and exciting ways.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As ChatGPT became available online, it became extremely popular and in just matter of days, almost everyone online wanted to use ChatGPT. It is often found being used at its max capacity levels and users have to wait for it to become available at times. As a result, ChatGPT Plus has been recently launched.</p>
