While digital technology is creating lot many opportunities, it also brings the perils of cybercrime,\u00a0which is affecting organizations and governments all across the globe.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most challenging part with cybercrime is that the risk landscape is constantly changing.\u00a0As technology advances, this challenge keeps intensifying. As existing hacking tools enhance and new tools come in to play, securing networks becomes more challenging.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cybersecurity is the only solution to protect your digital data and resources by mitigating security threats and vulnerabilities originating from cybercrime.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b><strong>So, what are we dealing with?<\/strong><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the most common cyber security threats are ransomware, malware, phishing and theft of personal and confidential data etc. Data breaches tops the list.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><b><strong><u>Phishing and Trojan Horse attacks<\/u><\/strong><\/b>:\u00a0Attacker sends malicious emails that appear to be originating from credible sources such as banks or similar credible organizations. When the recipient opens such emails, and\/or attachments and\/or clicks on a link in it, the malware enter target\u2019s network and steals or damage personal, sensitive and confidential information, customer details, intellectual property and more. Hackers might steal, delete, or corrupt data. Stolen data is either used for by hackers for their intended purpose or it might even get posted on the DarkNet for sale, or just get posted online for anyone to see.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<li><b><strong><u>DOS &#8211; Denial of Service<\/u><\/strong><\/b><b><strong><u>\u00a0attacks:<\/u><\/strong><\/b>\u00a0In a DOS attack, hackers penetrate into target\u2019s network and they send so many messages that overwhelms the target\u2019s network system, this prevents the authorized users from getting an access to the system and can create server outages and monetary loss and undue excessive pressure on the IT staff.<\/li>\n<li><b><strong><u>Ransomware:<\/u>\u00a0<\/strong><\/b>As the name indicates, the purpose of this type of attack is to hold the target to ransom.\u00a0Hackers penetrate into target\u2019s network and they encrypt data files on the target\u2019s network.

Access to data and resources should be on need-to-know-basis.<\/li>\n<li>Keep operating systems and other software up to date. An outdated software can become an easy entry point for hackers.<\/li>\n<li>Strong Password. It is a good idea to to have 12 characters password that has upper case letter(s), lower case letter(s), number(s) and special character(s).<\/li>\n<li>Network administrators to ensure safety of the\u00a0network by frequently changing network passwords.<\/li>\n<li>Install firewall and protective software like antivirus, antimalware, antispyware.<\/li>\n<li>Regularly scan devices for malware<\/li>\n<li>Train all employees on cyber security.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0If you rely on the internet for communication and for carrying out daily operations, you must use cybersecurity measures to safe guard your data and resources.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Author: Shital Rai<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LinkedIn:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/shitalrai\">www.linkedin.com\/in\/shitalrai<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our world is becoming more and more dependent on digital technologies.
