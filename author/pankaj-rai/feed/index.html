										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The company Meta,</strong> previously called Facebook, owns four of the most popular social media platforms worldwide, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Facebook, and Instagram.  This post is focused on Facebook.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2022, Facebook took action on <strong>1.6 billion fake accounts</strong>, In the first quarter of 2019, a record figure of approximately 2.2 billion fake accounts were removed by the social media platform.<br />
<strong>In India alone, there are nearly 239.65 million Facebook users</strong>, making it the leading country in terms of Facebook audience size. So, one can imagine, the larger the user base, the larger is the number of scammers.</p>
<p>The vast majority of those deleted accounts were automated accounts that are often created by software programs. We all know that bots have been used for years to manipulate people. The good news is that in recent years, Facebook, Twitter and other tech companies have gotten much better at catching bots.</p>
<p><strong>However, the challenge still lies when real humans create the fake accounts. </strong>In such cases, these social media companies have a much harder time catching them because such accounts are hard to identify, as they do not carry the same revealing digital signs of a bot. Approaches to find such accounts remain imperfect.  So, what can we do about it?</p>
<p>This means WE MUST OWN RESPONSIBILITY TO STAY SAFE. Here are some tips that can help you identify fake Facebook profiles.</p>
<p><strong>FIRST &amp; FOREMOST: TRUST BUT VERIFY</strong><br />
This means Do Not talk to strangers online. If you do not know them or recognize them, DO NOT accept friend request. These fake accounts would generally have an attractive photo because attractive photos entice people to befriend the account.</p>
<p><strong>DO A REVERSE IMAGE SEARCH<br />
</strong>If you want to know more, then the best way to identify a fake Facebook profile is to save the profile photo, and then do a reverse image search using <a href="https://www.google.com/imghp?hl=EN">https://www.google.com/imghp?hl=EN</a> or <a href="http://www.tineye.com">www.tineye.com</a>, and there are few more options that you may use to do a reverse image search. Doing so would reveal if the profile photo is real or fake? Such an exercise will show all the places where the photo has been used and it will be easy for you to spot if the profile photo is real or fake.</p>
<p><strong>SEEING YOUR FRIENDS ALREADY BEING FRIENDS WITH STRANGER’S ACCOUNT DOES NOT MEAN ACCOUNT IS REAL</strong><br />
It is also important to remember that if you find such accounts already friends with your friends, it does not mean the accounts is genuine or real. Please know that fake accounts can connect with your friends as well as you. If you are unsure about an account, DO NOT accept the friend request, but send a message and enquire how does this person know you or where did you meet? Chances are such accounts will never respond, and if you do get a response, verify the correctness of the response.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the other ways to spot a fake profile are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check if the picture truly looks real or appears to be taken from the internet</li>
<li>Check for group pictures on the account. Fake accounts would not have many group pictures</li>
<li>The information shared in the profile would seem far from real</li>
<li>Generally, fake accounts would not have wall posts on the Facebook page</li>
<li>Messages would be far from practical. You might find them too nice or too good to be true</li>
<li>Fake accounts are mostly fairly new accounts and not an old account</li>
<li>Fake accounts may have no friends or they may have very few friends.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remember, you can identify fake accounts, just stay alert!</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em style="color: #cf0a0a;">“KID</em></strong><strong><em style="color: #cf0a0a;">S ARE GROWING ON DIGITAL PLAYGROUNDS AND THERE IS NO RECESS.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em style="color: #cf0a0a;"> THE GAME GOES ON”. Kevin Honeycutt- Educator</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question: </strong>My kids can use computers easily. Do they still need to learn about Digital Literacy?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>If we know and agree that our kids are growing on digital platforms, and there is no RECESS in the game, then <strong>the answer to above question is a resounding YES. </strong>Beginning to acquire Digital Literacy in earlier grade levels and continuing through later grade levels is the need of the hour. Let’s look at some of the reasons for this:</p>
<p>Digital Technologies are so pervasive now that they have entered all areas of modern life. From this perspective, digital literacy in real sense is much more than the ability to handle computers. Just like the 3 ”R”s – reading, writing &amp; arithmetic, it comprises of a set of fundamental  set of skills which include the consumption and production of digital media, processing &amp; retrieving of information, creating and sharing of knowledge, and a wide range of other professional computing skills.</p>
<p>Digital literacy is <strong>now the key</strong> to almost all meaningful jobs as employers across the world look for digital literacy skills in prospective employees. Employers expect prospective employees to be digitally literate in real sense when they screen the job applications.</p>
<p>Digital Literacy works as a catalyst because it enables the acquisition of other important life skills.</p>
<p>But, one may still ask- what does it mean to be digitally literate, and what role can digital resources play to fulfill students’ academic needs? In this blog, we will try to answer this question and offer guidance about developing students into responsible citizens of the 21st Century Global Economy.</p>
<p>Digital Literacy enables students to access information from the internet and communicate the lessons learnt with others. COVID 19 Pandemic made remote/online learning essential which accelerated the need to use digital resources, especially for education. Digital resources are ever changing and include hyperlinks to visual or auditory sources, which when blended add meaning for the reader.</p>
<p><strong>What role do Digital Literacy &amp; Digital Resources play in fulfilling students’ academic needs?<br />
</strong>Being digitally literate enables students to learn via technology and this provides learners immense power in their hands to tap into the tons of digital resources of information available on the internet, allowing students a sense of informed discretion in the selection of materials they use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not only are there sources with written content such as news articles, online research journals, classic literature, poetry, and blogs, but also video sources such as vlogs, and YouTube. Audio sources like podcasts or audio files are also prominently available, as are many social media sites. Many sources are multimedia with a mixture of text, audio, and video.</li>
<li>Availability of vast number of online resources motivate students to actively explore these resources, and using their creativity, pick and choose the most effective and appealing sources to further their learning.</li>
<li>But the access to and power of self-selection comes with the obvious issue of being able to sort through huge amounts of information to decide what is credible and what is not credible? What is it that students should or should not rely upon to build their understanding of the world and then communicate it to others?</li>
<li>Digital Literate students can critically evaluate what is being said, and who is saying it? It enables them to understand that just because information is published on the internet, does not mean it is reliable, credible, or accurate. <em style="color: #cf0a0a;">Lot of people go to Wikipedia for research but the uninformed do not know that Wikipedia is not a source of credible information. Whereas Wikipedia itself says, it </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_of_Wikipedia#:~:text=The%20online%20encyclopedia%20does%20not,Wikipedia%20as%20a%20reliable%20source." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>does not consider itself as a reliable source of information for academic purposes or research.</em></a></li>
<li>Digital Literacy empowers students with the knowledge to differentiate between accurate information, misinformation, and disinformation in digital spaces. It also empowers students with power to reason, how to look for unsupported claims, and how to separate fact from opinion — beginning in earlier grade levels and continuing through later grade levels is the need of the hour.</li>
<li><em style="color: #cf0a0a;">Digital Literacy enables students to evaluate the perspective presented. For example, a website created to promote wind power may only show the positive impacts (e.g., unlimited resource, extremely low greenhouse gas emissions) and may hide the potential negative impacts (e.g., threat to local species, scar on the landscape) leaving students who are not digitally literate with only one side of the issue.</em></li>
<li><em style="color: #cf0a0a;">Digital Literacy empowers students to investigate the purpose of the website and also verify not only the information presented but also any possible missing information, such as opposing views, to form their own fact based viewpoint. </em></li>
<li>There can’t be any debate that as creators of the information, students bear the responsibility for producing content that is credible and trustworthy and not something that has been picked from internet without verification, which may be incorrect information.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is the responsibility of all education leaders and parents to ensure students have the foundational digital literacy skill for their higher-level studies and for building future careers.</p>
<p>We invite all education leaders and parents to enroll kids between the ages of 8-14 in <a href="http://www.compudonjunior.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.compudonjunior.in</a> &#8211; the national championship on digital literacy and help them acquire this very important skill from the young age.</p>

<p>This article aims to serve as a call to action.</p>
<p>The above quote speaks volumes about our role as parents &amp; educators and there is no doubt that parents, educators and Schools are doing a great deal of work in that direction. <span id="dots2">&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span id="more2">However, with this article, I wish to draw your attention to a <strong>very forceful threat that is looming large on our kids and the intensity of which has increased multifold because of COVID-19.</strong></span></p>
<p>I am referring to the dangers that our kids are exposed to on daily basis because of not being digitally literate. We tend to believe that today’s kids are digitally literate because they are digital natives, i.e., born in the digital age but research has proven that when it comes to being safe in the cyber space, they simply lack the skills that would keep them safe. Kids who are not digitally literate are exposed to dangers of cyber space. Like if we are not proficient drivers on a high-way, we are carrying a significant risk and same is the case with information highway.</p>
<p>Here is some data from the western world, the world which is much ahead of us in terms of technology adoption and its ability to teach and use technology.</p>
<p><strong>“Two-thirds of teachers are aware of pupils sharing inappropriate content, with as many as one in six of these children of primary school age.” </strong>NASUWT teaching union <strong>“More Than 75 percent of Fifth and Eighth Graders are Non-Proficient in 21st Century Skills” </strong>&#8211; Learning.com study</p>
<p><strong>“A majority of U.S. adults can answer fewer than half the questions correctly on a digital knowledge quiz, and many struggle with certain cybersecurity and privacy questions”</strong> &#8211; Pew Center for Internet and Technology- October 2019 report</p>
<p>Digital literacy is not just knowing how to post messages/photos on Facebook or snapchat or Instagram, it is lot more than that.</p>
<p>Staying online and that too in isolation like it is happening because of COVID-19, has made our kids very vulnerable to criminals and bullies. <strong>Criminals can negatively influence and hack our kids’ minds which at times can lead to real physical and psychological issues.</strong> There is ton of data that criminals are exposing vulnerable and impressionable kids to misinformation, manipulation, and fake news, which causes all kinds of issues in their lives.
