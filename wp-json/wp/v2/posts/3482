We tend to believe that today\u2019s kids are digitally literate because they are digital natives, i.e., born in the digital age but research has proven that when it comes to being safe in the cyber space, they simply lack the skills that would keep them safe. Kids who are not digitally literate are exposed to dangers of cyber space. Like if we are not proficient drivers on a high-way, we are carrying a significant risk and same is the case with information highway.<\/p>\n<p>Here is some data from the western world, the world which is much ahead of us in terms of technology adoption and its ability to teach and use technology.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cTwo-thirds of teachers are aware of pupils sharing inappropriate content, with as many as one in six of these children of primary school age.\u201d\u00a0<\/strong>NASUWT teaching union\u00a0<strong>\u201cMore Than 75 percent of Fifth and Eighth Graders are Non-Proficient in 21st Century Skills\u201d\u00a0<\/strong>&#8211; Learning.com study<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cA majority of U.S. adults can answer fewer than half the questions correctly on a digital knowledge quiz, and many struggle with certain cybersecurity and privacy questions\u201d<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; Pew Center for Internet and Technology- October 2019 report<\/p>\n<p>Digital literacy is not just knowing how to post messages\/photos on Facebook or snapchat or Instagram, it is lot more than that.<\/p>\n<p>Staying online and that too in isolation like it is happening because of COVID-19, has made our kids very vulnerable to criminals and bullies.\u00a0<strong>Criminals can negatively influence and hack our kids\u2019 minds which at times can lead to real physical and psychological issues.<\/strong>\u00a0There is ton of data that criminals are exposing vulnerable and impressionable kids to misinformation, manipulation, and fake news, which causes all kinds of issues in their lives. Who doesn\u2019t know about the horror of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nth_room_case\">Nth Room Case?<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The unpredictable changes and the speed of the changes in technology and the cosmic and ubiquitous internet has made it mandatory for everyone to be digitally literate, especially young kids. Digital Literacy is already an essential skill for lots of jobs and this will only go up in the coming years.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The above clearly conveys that teaching digital literacy to our kids is mission-critical.<\/strong>\u00a0We educators have a great responsibility and we must help our kids by motivating them to acquire digital literacy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stay tuned for my next article later this week<\/strong>\u00a0with some more insight on this problem and some easy and very feasible solution(s).<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the Author:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For over a decade, Pankaj has been a noteworthy leader in the entry level global certifications space.
